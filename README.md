# desk-manager
 A macOS app that swaps files in and out of your desktop folder.

## Usage
* Place the app file in `/Applications`, and launch the app. Upon the first launch, you will likely be asked for permission to control system events and access your desktop folder. This is for auto-launching the app and swapping the files.
* You will notice that there's now a "Desktop Workspaces" folder under your home directory. This is where all the desktop folders live.
* Any folder you create here will be automatically added to the menu, and you can select an item in the menu to swap it out.
